# Factory Pattern

## [Factory Method Pattern](https://github.com/YIshihara11201/iOSTips/blob/main/Factory%20Pattern/FactoryMethodPattern.md)

- Factory Method relies on inheritance: object creation is delegated to subclasses, which implement the factory method to create objects.  
- The intent of Factory Method is to allow a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses.

## [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/YIshihara11201/iOSTips/blob/main/Factory%20Pattern/AbstractFactoryPattern.md)
- Abstract Factory relies on object composition: object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface.  
- The intent of Abstract Factory is to create families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes.
