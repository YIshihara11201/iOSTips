## Summary
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.  
Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure.

## Points
- A template method defines the steps of an algorithm, deferring to subclasses for the implementation of those steps.  
- Hooks are methods that do nothing or default behavior in the abstract class, but may be overridden in the subclass.  
- To prevent subclasses from changing the algorithm in the template method, declare the template method as final.
