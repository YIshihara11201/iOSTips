## Summary
The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Points
- You use this pattern when you have collections of objects with whole-part relationships and you want to be able to treat those objects uniformly.
- All components must implement the *Component* interface; however, because leaves and nodes have different roles we canâ€™t always define a default implementation for each method that makes sense. Sometimes the best you can do is throw a runtime exception.
